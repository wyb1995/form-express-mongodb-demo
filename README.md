this is a use of a form + express + mongodb get user input information written and queries in the database, if there is no data will be stored in the database , and jump to a specified page ( I am here to jump to Baidu page ) , if such data exists , it will not do anything , the page will not jump  


You should perform the following shell operations

```
npm install
```

The first thing you need to open your mongodb server and node index.js, and then open your browser and go to localhost: 3000
